# Interactive-Orchestrator
An interactive orchestrator I made for an assignement for one of my music courses.

Allows the user to choose different orchestrations by choosing an intensity level and a "tone" (the two options of which are melodic or textural) through a GUI. 
Dragging the mouse from zone to zone allows the user to vary these parameters in real-time, allowing for changes on the fly.

Written using processing.
